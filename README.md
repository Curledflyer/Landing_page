# Landing_page
This project will be used to test my ability to put into practice everything I have learned to this point.

I will use HTML, CSS, google, and my learning of flexbox to create a landing page that will hopefully help to cement all my knowledge.

I'd like to also use this landing page in the future and add on to it as I learn more after this assignment.  Javascript soon, and anything else I learn.
